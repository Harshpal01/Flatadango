## Flatadango
Overview
Flatadango is an interactive movie ticketing web application that brings the movie theater experience right to your browser. With Flatadango, users can view a curated list of movies currently showing, check out detailed information for each film, and purchase tickets directly from the app. The interface updates dynamically as tickets are sold, so you always see real-time availability.

## Features
Movie Showcase:

View the poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets for the featured movie on page load.

Movie List Navigation:

A sidebar displays all movies available. Clicking on any movie updates the main display with that filmâ€™s details.

Ticket Purchase:

Purchase a ticket for the selected movie with a single click. The available ticket count decreases accordingly.

When a movie is sold out (no available tickets), the app marks it as "Sold Out" and disables further ticket purchases.

Server Persistence:

All ticket sales and updates are persisted on the backend using API calls, ensuring the data remains accurate between sessions.
